For this project, I was tasked with creating a Python script to gather all available barcodes from a specific category 
of an online store. Following that, I developed a robot for automatic data entry to check which of the gathered barcodes
are not listed on another website. Previously, this task was done manually, and by automating it, 
the employees' productivity per hour has almost doubled!
